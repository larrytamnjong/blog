To me, accessibility in software is simply where lines of code meet inclusivity. As an upcoming contributor on the Ushahidi platform and a member of the open-source learning community, I'm embarking on the task to improve the accessibility on the Ushahidi platform. The challenge today? Writing a comprehensive guide on how I would go about testing Ushahidi for accessibility. So, after days of scavenging the internet and mostly my brain \u2013 I'm going to unveil the techniques I would use in testing Ushahidi for accessibility.</p>"},{"location":"ushahidiaccessibility/#step-1-immersing-myself-into-the-ushahidi-platform","title":"Step 1: Immersing myself into the Ushahidi platform","text":"<p>Every software can be viewed through two lenses: the lens of the developer and the lens of the end user. It's often easy for a developer to solely focus on the software from the development perspective, which may not align precisely with diverse users experiences. The first thing I would do when testing the Ushahidi platform for accessibility is to immerse myself and use the platform from the perspective of the end user.</p>"},{"location":"ushahidiaccessibility/#step-2-understanding-standardized-accessibility-guidelines","title":"Step 2: Understanding standardized Accessibility Guidelines","text":"<p>In today's world, following global standards and guidelines is important for directing us toward the right procedures to create better products. Following global guidelines can significantly enhance the end-user experience of software. My next step in testing the Ushahidi platform for accessibility is to understand global accessibility guidelines, such as the <code>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</code>. Understanding WCAG principles will serve to me as a trusty map in the digital wilderness of accessibility. These guidelines provide the principles to follow for an accessible user experience, acting as my compass in ensuring inclusivity.</p>"},{"location":"ushahidiaccessibility/#step-3-setting-up-a-test-environment","title":"Step 3: Setting Up a test environment","text":"<p>My next step will be to find and put in place the necessary tools needed to test the Ushahidi platform for accessibility. Setting up tools such as accessiBe, Siteimprove, Google Lighthouse, axe DevTools, VoiceOver and other necessary browser extensions. In this step basically my laptop will become an accessibility testing lab.</p>"},{"location":"ushahidiaccessibility/#step-4-find-bugs-and-document","title":"Step 4: Find bugs and document","text":"<p>Using the tools I set up in <code>Step 3</code>, I will literally become a hunter, scouring the Ushahidi platform for any accessibility issues. I'll diligently hunt down all bugs and areas in the platform where someone with an impairment might face challenges accessing content. Once I identify a bug, I'll thoroughly document it for further analysis and resolution.</p>"},{"location":"ushahidiaccessibility/#step-5-become-a-keyboard-addict","title":"Step 5: Become a keyboard addict","text":"<p>In this step I will navigate the Ushahidi platform using only my keyboard. This hands-on approach is aimed to ensure that users can navigate through the platform with or without a mouse. This particular test is very important because people with motor impairments would often use the keyboard than mouse.</p>"},{"location":"ushahidiaccessibility/#step-6-go-in-for-a-screen-reader-adventure","title":"Step 6: Go in for a screen reader adventure","text":"<p>Screen readers play a crucial role in accessibility, especially for individuals who are visually impaired. They heavily rely on screen readers to navigate the Ushahidi platform. In my testing process, I will utilize screen readers to explore the application and listen attentively to the melodies of text and alternative text being read out. This step is instrumental in ensuring that the platform provides a seamless and meaningful experience for users with visual impairments.</p>"},{"location":"ushahidiaccessibility/#step-7-color-exploration","title":"Step 7: Color exploration","text":"<p>Using tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker I will go ahead to check the color accessibility of the ushahidi platform.</p>"},{"location":"ushahidiaccessibility/#step-8-document-my-findings","title":"Step 8: Document my findings","text":"<p>Documentation is just as important as every other aspect of this guideline. I will  document my findings, creating a blueprint for enhancing the accessibility of the Ushahidi platform. These records will serve as a valuable resource for implementing necessary improvements and ensuring a more inclusive user experience.</p>"},{"location":"ushahidiaccessibility/#step-9-test-with-actual-accessibility","title":"Step 9: Test with actual accessibility","text":"<p>According to me the ultimate validation of accessibility efforts comes from real users with diverse abilities. In this step, I will engage with individuals who have disabilities to ensure that the Ushahidi platform genuinely meets their needs. This step involves real-world testing scenarios with users facing specific challenges, such as those with motor disabilities or visual impairments.</p> <p>So, why embark on this journey? The benefits are boundless! By ensuring Ushahidi's accessibility, we empower users of all abilities. We create an open digital frontier, welcoming diverse voices and experiences. The code we write isn't just lines \u2013 it's a bridge connecting people.</p>"}]}
