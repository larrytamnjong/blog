# Welcome

Dig into my blog for some great articles and maybe a few typos! Click your desired topic or type in the search bar. 
Walk with me as I stumble through my open-source journey of ```coding to make the world better```, remember to check back for more. And hey, feel free to drop me a line at ```larrytabeh@gmail.com``` â€“ I promise not to reply in binary code!
