# A Guide to Testing Accessibility on Ushahidi

Today, we will be looking into the world of accessibility. To me, accessibility in software is simply where lines of code meet inclusivity. As an upcoming contributor to the Ushahidi platform and a member of the open-source learning community, I'm embarking on a task to improve the accessibility of the Ushahidi platform. The challenge today? Writing a comprehensive guide on how I would go about testing Ushahidi for accessibility. So, after days of scavenging the internet and mostly my brain – I'm going to unveil the techniques I would use in testing Ushahidi for accessibility.


## Step 1: Immersing myself into the Ushahidi platform

Every software can be viewed through two lenses: the lens of the developer and the lens of the end user. It's often easy for a developer to solely focus on the software from the development perspective, which may not align precisely with the user's experience. The first thing I would do when testing the Ushahidi platform for accessibility is to immerse myself and use the platform from the perspective of the end user.

## Step 2: Understanding standardized Accessibility Guidelines 

In today's world, following global standards and guidelines is important for directing us toward the right procedures to create better products. Following global guidelines can significantly enhance the end-user experience of software. My next step in testing the Ushahidi platform for accessibility is to understand global accessibility guidelines, such as the ```Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)```. Understanding WCAG principles will serve to me as a trusty map in the digital wilderness of accessibility. These guidelines provide the principles to follow for an accessible user experience, acting as my compass in ensuring inclusivity.

## Step 3: Setting Up a test environment

My next step will be to find and put in place the necessary tools needed to test the Ushahidi platform for accessibility. Tools such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and browser extensions. In this step basically my laptop will become an accessibility testing lab.

## Step 4: Find bugs and document

Using the tools I set up in ```Step 3```, I will literally become a hunter, scouring the Ushahidi platform for any accessibility issues. I'll diligently hunt down all bugs and areas in the app where someone with a difficulty might face challenges accessing content. Once I identify a bug, I'll thoroughly document it for further analysis and resolution.

## Step 5: Become a keyboard addict

In this step I will Navigate the Ushahidi platform using only my keyboard. This hands-on approach ensures that users can navigate through the platform with or without a mouse.

## Step 6: Go in for a screen reader adventure

Screen readers play a crucial role in accessibility, especially for individuals who are visually impaired. They heavily rely on screen readers to navigate the Ushahidi platform. In my testing process, I will utilize screen readers to explore the application and listen attentively to the melodies of text and alternative text being read out. This step is instrumental in ensuring that the platform provides a seamless and meaningful experience for users with visual impairments.

## Step 7: Color exploration 

Using tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker I will go ahead to check the color accessibility to the ushahidi platform.


## Step 8: Document my findings

Documentation is just as important as every other aspect of this guideline. I will  document my findings, creating a blueprint for enhancing the accessibility of the Ushahidi platform. These records will serve as a valuable resource for implementing necessary improvements and ensuring a more inclusive user experience.

So, why embark on this journey? The benefits are boundless! By ensuring Ushahidi's accessibility, we empower users of all abilities. We create an open digital frontier, welcoming diverse voices and experiences. The code we write isn't just lines – it's a bridge connecting people.
